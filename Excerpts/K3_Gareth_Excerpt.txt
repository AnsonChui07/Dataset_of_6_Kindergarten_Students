Good morning, Shunem! I'm excited to draw. What are we going to draw today?
Hello, Mr. Seal! I remember him. He's so funny.
It could be a building or even a cup. I want to draw a cup of coffee.
I'll draw a cup of coffee. I'll use these crayons and stickers to decorate it.
I just like the color orange. It makes my coffee look special.
Oh, I love cars! I'll put a car on my cup. It'll make my coffee even more unique.
Yes, I did! They were beautiful and pink. I also went to Osaka, but it was raining there.
It was exciting! I played on fast rides, and my mom and dad shouted. I didn't shout though.
Yes, I have! I played on the splash ride and got wet. My dad's eyelashes got wet too.
I know Duffy! But my mom didn't buy me one because I'm not at Disneyland.
I love chicken wings and hamburgers. Oh, and ice cream!
I want to put a straw in my coffee and add some stickers. And maybe even a robot!
I think my coffee is going to be the best-looking one ever.
Shunem, can we play a game after we finish drawing?
Let's play mouse and cat on paper. I'll be the cat, and you can be the mouse.
Okay, let's do it!
I'm chasing you, mouse!
It looks like a head and a beak. Maybe it's a goose.
I remember seeing trains there. It was so cool.
Me too! I had so much fun.
Thank you, Shunem! Can we draw again tomorrow?
Bye
