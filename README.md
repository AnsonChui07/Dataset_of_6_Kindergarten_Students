##  What This Project Does

### Overview
- **Data Collection**: 
  - 15-minute guided drawing task and a "Colour Pencil Mouse-and-Cat" mini-game.
  - Audio recordings (mp3), annotated transcripts (txt), part of speech tags (txt), tokenization (json) and artwork images (JPEG) from **6 children** (1 boy + 1 girl per grade: PN, K2, K3).
  - Participants: Children from an international Nursery & Kindergarten (Hong Kong), selected based on parental perceptions of "low English proficiency."
- **Objective**: 
  - Analyze linguistic features.
  - Discover grammatical mistakes.
  - Provide actionable insights to parents/teachers about hidden language strengths.

### Key Features
-  Creative task design inspired by art therapy and design thinking.
-  Structured metadata: Participant age, language background, and family background.

## Why This Project Is Useful

### Addressing Gaps in Research
- **Unstructured Settings**: Most datasets focus on classroom-based interactions; this project prioritizes **low-pressure, creative environments**.
- **Parental Misconceptions**: Challenges assumptions about "low proficiency" by revealing childrenâ€™s abilities under guided conversations and additional tools.
- **Reuse Potential**: 
  - For educators: Design language development activities.
  - For NLP: Train models on child speech patterns.
